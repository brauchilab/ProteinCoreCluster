# ProteinCoreCluster
ProteinCoreCluster Identify the aromatic residues facing the internal cavity formed by the TM1 to TM4 helixes in a set of ion channel structures extracted from PDB files, returning a list for each PDB file of pairs and clusters of aromatic residues with lower distances, compared with a given threshold.
